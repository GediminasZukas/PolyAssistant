# PolyAssistant

Incremental annotation processor which helps to (de)serialize Kotlin polymorphic types with [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) in a simple way.

### Problem example

Consider such Kotlin sealed class:

```
sealed class Shape {
    abstract val area: Double
    data class Rectangle(override val area: Double) : Shape()
    data class Circle(override val area: Double) : Shape()
}
```

By default Gson doesn't know how to deserialize `Shape` and such attempt would produce an error:

```
val shape = Shape.Circle(area = 3.8)
val shapeJson = gsonInstance.toJson(shape)
val deserializedShape = gsonInstance.fromJson(shapeJson, Shape::class.java) // error
println("Shape area is: ${deserializedShape.area}")
```

### Solution with the library

1. Add few annotations to the sealed class hierarchy:

```
@Polymorphic
sealed class Shape {
    abstract val area: Double
    @Subtype
    data class Rectangle(override val area: Double) : Shape()
    @Subtype
    data class Circle(override val area: Double) : Shape()
}
```

2. Try to build your project and link generated code with your gson instance builder:

```
GsonBuilder().apply {
    GeneratedRuntimeTypeAdapterFactories.registerIn(this)
}.create()
```

Wolla! Step 2 is required only once. For further problems just annotate your types like in step 1.

Library supports not only sealed classes but also other languge-common polymorphic types hierarchies. 

### Internals

Annotation processor basically generates [RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/extras/src/main/java/com/google/gson/typeadapters/RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory.java) objects (gson solution for polymorphic types serialization) and adds each of them into supplied ```GsonBuilder```.
